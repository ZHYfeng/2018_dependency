## 1. what the artifact does

This artifact is for paper "Demystifying the Dependency Challenge in Kernel Fuzzing". 
Fuzz testing operating system kernels remains a daunting task to date. 
One known challenge is that much of the kernel code is locked under specific kernel states and current kernel fuzzers are not effective in exploring such an enormous state space. 
We refer to this problem as the dependency challenge. 
Though there are some efforts trying to address the dependency challenge, the prevalence and categorization of dependencies have never been studied. 
Most prior work simply attempted to recover dependencies opportunistically whenever they are relatively easy to recognize. 
We undertake a substantial measurement study to systematically understand the real challenge behind dependencies.
In one word, the artifact is to help researchers to understand the dependency challenge in kernel fuzzing.
