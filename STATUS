We want to claim Reusable and Available badges.

For Reusable badge, as we mentioned in our paper, we only picked four kernel modules because of limited human resource.
However, our tool can help researchers to analyze the uncovered code in other kernel modules or newer version of the kernel modules.
We have already provided evaluation environment for other kernel modules besides the four in our paper (more detail in README).
So after resolving the root causes mentioned in the paper,  we may still need to another round of deep analysis of kernel modules.

For Available badge, we have already made our code and results available in \url{https://www.doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5348989} and \url{https://www.doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5441138}.
And we also open source the source code of our tool in Github \url{https://github.com/ZHYfeng/Dependency} with Apache-2.0 License.
